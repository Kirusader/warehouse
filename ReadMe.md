# Warehouse Automation System

This project implements a simulation-based warehouse automation system leveraging **Q-Learning** (a reinforcement learning technique) for optimised task allocation, navigation, and collision avoidance. The system features robots that autonomously pick and place items in a grid-based warehouse layout, ensuring efficiency in operations.

## Features
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Utilises Q-Learning for dynamic pathfinding and task assignment.
- **Grid-Based Environment**: Customisable warehouse layout visualised using `turtle` graphics.
- **Interactive Interface**: Developed using `Tkinter` for real-time user interaction and visual feedback.
- **Performance Metrics**: Tracks task completion rates, distance travelled, and memory usage.
